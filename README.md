# Deep Reinforcement Learning

The problem is based on allowing the agent to learn a *policy* using CNN and RL techniques. The environment taken into consideration is an Atari game called **Gopher** provided by the gym package (Open AI, 2017). This game has a discrete action space and considerably resizable observation space.

The problem can be divided into two subsections:
1.	Working with gym to model Atari environments
1.	Use a CNN to learn Q-function
